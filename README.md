Ensemble of 3 solutions.

Goal
Identify cancers among skin lesions cropped from 3D total body photographs.
In this competition, you'll develop image-based algorithms to identify histologically confirmed skin cancer cases with single-lesion crops from 3D total body photos (TBP).
The image quality resembles close-up smartphone photos, which are regularly submitted for telehealth purposes.
Bbinary classification algorithm could be used in settings without access to specialized care and improve triage for early skin cancer detection.

Evaluation
Primary Scoring Metric
Submissions are evaluated on partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC) above 80% true positive rate (TPR) for binary classification of malignant examples.

Submission File
For each image (isic_id) in the test set,we predict the probability (target) that the lesion is malignant.
